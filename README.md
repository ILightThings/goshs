# Examples

**Serve from your current directory**

`goshs`

**Serve from your current directory with webdav enabled on custom port**

`goshs -w -wp 8081`

**Serve from another directory**

`goshs -d /path/to/directory`

**Serve from port 1337**

`goshs -p 1337`

**Password protect the service**

`goshs -b secret-user:VeryS3cureP4$$w0rd`

*Please note:* goshs uses HTTP basic authentication. It is recommended to use SSL option with basic authentication to prevent from credentials beeing transfered in cleartext over the line.

**Use TLS connection**

*Self-Signed*

`goshs -s -ss`

*Provide own certificate*

`goshs -s -sk server.key -sc server.crt`
